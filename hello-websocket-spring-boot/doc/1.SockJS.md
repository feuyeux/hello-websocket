# SockJS

- [SockJS protocol](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-protocol)
- [SockJS client](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/)

The goal of SockJS is to let applications use a WebSocket API but fall back to non-WebSocket alternatives when necessary at runtime, without the need to change application code.
